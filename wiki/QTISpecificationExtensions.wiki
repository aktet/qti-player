#summary QTI Specification extensions implemented in player

= Introduction =

This page describes the extensions to QTI specification that are implemented in qtiplayer.


= Response processing =

=== math_correct_multiple template ===

In order to enable the positioning more than one module per item (per page), an additional *Response Processing template* has been created.

The mentioned template matches the answers' correctenes for each module in a page. It's like it executes _match_correct_ template for each response declaration and then summarizes the result for each comparison.

The name for the template is: 
*_match_correct_multiple_*

The address for the template is: 
*_http://www.ydp.eu/qti/rptemplates/match_correct_multiple.xml_*

So if you plan to use it, please append in the assessment item definition the response processing template information as follows
{{{
<responseProcessing template="http://www.ydp.eu/qti/rptemplates/match_correct_multiple"/>
}}}

The template _match_correct_multiple_ is made a default template in case no template is specified in the assessment item definition.
