#summary Development roadmap

== Version 0.1 ==
First 0.1 release should be usable with one choice activity.

  * HTML text
  * Pictures
  * Single and multiple choice
  * CSS styles for player
  * Standard match_correct response processing

== Version 1.0 ==
After version 0.1 my plan is to go directly to version 1.0. This version will support one more activity and possibility to send results to the server. But this version have to be stable enough to be used on production servers.

  * Support for inline choice interaction
  * Send user score to the server
  * Full CSS support
